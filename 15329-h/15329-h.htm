<p>The answerers who rushed into print in 1712 against Swift’s
<i>Proposal for Correcting, Improving and Ascertaining the English
Tongue</i> were so obviously moved by the spirit of faction that, apart
from a few debating points and minor corrections, it is difficult to
disentangle their legitimate criticisms from their political prejudices.
As Professor Landa has written in his introduction to Oldmiron’s
<i>Reflections on Dr. Swift’s Letter to Harley</i> and Mainwaring’s
<i>The British Academy</i> (<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Auguston’">Augustan</ins> Reprint Society, 1948): “It is not as
literature that these two answers to Swift are to be judged. They are
minor, though interesting, documents in political warfare which cut
athwart a significant cultural controversy.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth Elstob’s <i>Apology for the Study of Northern
Antiquities</i> prefixed to her <i>Rudiments of Grammar for the
English-Saxon Tongue</i> is an answer of a very different kind. It did
not appear until 1715; it exhibits no political bias; it agrees with
Swift’s denunciation of certain current linguistic habits; and it does
not reject the very idea of regulating the language as repugnant to the
sturdy independence of the Briton. Elizabeth Elstob speaks not for a
party but for the group of antiquarian scholars, led by Dr. Hickes, who
were developing and popularizing the study of the Anglo-Saxon origins of
the English language--a study which had really started in the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>What irritated Miss Elstob in the <i>Proposal</i> was not Swift’s
eulogy or Harley and the Tory ministry, but his scornful reference to
antiquarians as “laborious
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
men of low genius,” his failure to recognize that his manifest ignorance
of the origins of the language was any bar to his pronouncing on it or
legislating for it, and his repetition of some of the traditional
criticisms of the Teutonic elements in the language, in particular the
monosyllables and consonants. Her sense of injury was personal as well
as academic. Her brother William and her revered master Dr. Hickes were
among the antiquarians whom Swift had casually insulted, and she herself
had published an elaborate edition of <i>An English-Saxon Homily on the
Birthday of St. Gregory</i> (1709) and was at work on an Anglo-Saxon
homilarium. Moreover she had a particular affection for her field of
study, because it had enabled her to surmount the obstacles to learning
which had been put in her path as a girl, and which had prevented her,
then, from acquiring a classical education. Her <i>Rudiments</i>, the
first Anglo-Saxon grammar written in English, was specifically designed
to encourage ladies suffering from similar educational disabilities to
find an intellectual pursuit. Her personal indignation is shown in her
sharp answer to Swift’s insulting phrase, and in her retaliatory
classification of the Dean among the “light and fluttering wits.”</p>

<p>As a linguistic historian she has no difficulty in exposing Swift’s
ignorance, and in establishing her claim that if there is any refining
or ascertaining of the English language to be done, the antiquarian
scholars must be consulted. But it is when she writes as a literary
critic, defending the English language, with its monosyllables and
consonants, as a literary medium, that she is most interesting.</p>

<p>There was nothing new in what Swift had said of the character of the
English language; he was merely echoing criticisms which had been
expressed frequently since the early sixteenth century. The number of
English monosyllables was sometimes complained of, because to ears
trained on the classical languages they sounded harsh, barking, unfitted
for eloquence; sometimes because they were believed to impede the
metrical flow in poetry; sometimes because, being particularly
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
characteristic of colloquial speech, they were considered low; and often
because they were associated with the languages of the Teutonic tribes
which had escaped the full refining influence of Roman civilization.
Swift followed writers like Nash and Dekker in emphasizing the first and
last of these objections.</p>

<p>There were, of course, stock answers to these stock objections. Such
criticism of one’s mother tongue was said to be unpatriotic or
positively disloyal. If it was difficult to maintain that English was as
smooth and euphonious as Italian, it could be maintained that its
monosyllables and consonants gave it a characteristic and masculine
brevity and force. Monosyllables were also very convenient for the
formation of compound words, and, it was argued, should, when properly
managed, be an asset rather than a handicap to the English rhymester. By
the time Swift and Miss Elstob were writing, an increasing number of
antiquarian Germanophils (and also pro-Hanoverians) were prepared to
claim Teutonic descent with pride.</p>

<p>Most of these arguments had been bandied backwards and forwards
rather inconclusively since the sixteenth century, and Addison in <i>The
Spectator</i> No. 135 expresses a typically moderate opinion on the
matter: the English language, he says, abounds in monosyllables,</p>

<p class = "inset">
which gives us an opportunity of delivering our thoughts in few sounds.
This indeed takes off from the elegance of our tongue, but at the same
time expresses our ideas in the readiest manner, and consequently
answers the first design of speech better than the multitude of
syllables, which make the words of other languages more tunable and
sonorous.</p>

<p>It is likely that neither Swift nor Miss Elstob would have found much
to disagree with in that sentence. Swift certainly never proposed any
reduction in the number of English monosyllables, and the simplicity of
style which he described as “one of the greatest perfections in any
language,” which seemed to him best exemplified in the English Bible,
and which he himself practised so
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
brilliantly, has in English a very marked monosyllabic character.</p>

<p>But in his enthusiasm to stamp out the practice of abbreviating,
beheading and curtailing polysyllables--a practice which seemed to him a
threat to both the elegance and permanence of the language--he described
it as part of a tendency of the English to relapse into their Northern
barbarity by multiplying monosyllables and eliding vowels between the
rough and frequent consonants of their language. His ignorance of the
historical origins of the language and his rather hackneyed remarks on
its character do not invalidate the general scheme of his
<i>Proposal</i> or his particular criticisms of current linguistic
habits, but they did lay him open to the very penetrating and decisive
attack of Elizabeth Elstob.</p>

<p>In her reply to Swift she repeats all the stock defenses of the
English monosyllables and consonants, but, by presenting them in
combination, and in a manner at once scholarly and forceful, she makes
the most convincing case against Swift. Unlike most of her predecessors,
Miss Elstob is not on the defensive. She is always ready to give a sharp
personal turn to her scholarly refutations--as, for instance, when she
demonstrates the usefulness of monosyllables in poetry by illustrations
from a series of poets beginning with Homer and ending with Swift. There
can be little doubt that Swift is decisively worsted in this
argument.</p>

<p>It is not known whether Swift ever read Miss Elstob’s
<i>Rudiments</i>, though it is interesting to notice a marked change of
emphasis in his references to the Anglo-Saxon language. In the
<i>Proposal</i> he had declared with a pretense of knowledge, that
Anglo-Saxon was “excepting some few variations in the orthography... the
same in most original words with our present English, as well as with
German and other northern dialects.” But in <i>An Abstract of the
History of England</i> (probably revised in 1719) he says that the
English which came in with the Saxons was “extremely different from what
it is now.” The two statements are not incompatible,
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
but the emphasis is remarkably changed. It is possible that some friend
had pointed out to Swift that his earlier statement was too gross a
simplification, or alternatively that someone had drawn his attention to
Elizabeth Elstob’s <i>Rudiments</i>.</p>

<p>All writers owe much to the labors of scholarship and are generally
ill-advised to scorn or reject them, however uninspired and uninspiring
they may seem. Moreover when authors do enter into dispute with
“laborious men of low genius” they frequently meet with more than their
match. Miss Elstob’s bold and aggressive defense of Northern antiquities
was remembered and cited by a later scholar, George Ballard, as a
warning to those who underestimated the importance of a sound knowledge
of the language. Indeed, he wrote, “I thought that the bad success Dean
Swift had met with in this affair from the incomparably learned and
ingenious Mrs. Elstob would have deterred all others from once venturing
in this affair.” (John Nichols, <i>Illustrations of the Literary History
of the Eighteenth Century</i>,
1822, IV, 212.)</p>

align = "left" alt = "S">OON after the Publication of the Homily on St.
Gregory, I was engaged by the Importunity of my Friends, to make a Visit
to <em>Canterbury</em>, as well to enjoy the Conversations of my Friends
and Relations there, as for that Benefit which I hoped to receive from
Change of Air, and freer Breathing, which is the usual Expectation of
those, who are used to a sedentary Life and Confinement in the great
City, and which renders such an Excursion
<span class = "pagenum">ii</span>
now and then excusable. In this Recess, among the many Compliments and
kind Expressions, which their favourable Acceptance of my first Attempt
in <em>Saxon</em>, had obtained for me from the Ladies, I was more
particularly gratified, with the new Friendship and Conversation, of a
young Lady, whose Ingenuity and Love of Learning, is well known and
esteem’d, not only in that Place, but by your self: and which so far
indear’d itself to me, by her promise that she wou’d learn the <em>Saxon
Tongue</em>, and do me the Honour to be my <em>Scholar</em>, as to make
me think of composing an <em>English Grammar</em> of that Language for
her use. That Ladies Fortune hath so disposed of her since that time,
and hath placed her at so great distance, as that we have had no
Opportunity, of treating farther on this Matter, either by Discourse or
Correspondence. However though a Work of a larger Extent, and which hath
amply experienced your Encouragement, did for some time make me lay
aside this Design, yet I did not wholly reject it. For having re-assumed
this Task, and accomplish’d it in such manner at I was able, I now send
it to you, for your Correction, and that Stamp of Authority, it must
needs receive from a Person of such perfect and exact Judgement in these
Matters, in order to make it current, and worthy of Reception from the
Publick. Indeed I might well have spared my self the labour of such an
Attempt, after the elaborate Work of your rich and learned
<em>Thesaurus</em>, and the ingenious Compendium of it by Mr.
<em>Thwaites</em>; but considering the Pleasure I my self had reaped
from the Knowledge I have gained from this Original of our Mother
Tongue, and that others of my own Sex, might be capable of the same
Satisfaction: I resolv’d to give them the Rudiments of that Language in
an English Dress. However not ’till I
<span class = "pagenum">iii</span>
<span class = "folionum">B2</span>
had communicated to you my Design for your Advice, and had receiv’d your
repeated Exhortation, and Encouragement to the Undertaking.</p>

<p>The Method I have used, is neither entirely new, out of a Fondness
and Affectation of Novelty: nor exactly the same with what has been in
use, in teaching the learned Languages. I have retain’d the old Division
of the Parts of Speech, nor have I rejected the other common Terms of
<em>Grammar</em>; I have only endeavour’d to explain them in such a
manner, as to hope they may be competently understood, by those whose
Education, hath not allow’d them an Acquaintance with the Grammars of
other Languages. There is one Addition to what your self and Mr.
<em>Thwaites</em> have done on this Subject, for which you will, I
imagine, readily pardon me: I have given most, if not all the
<em>Grammatical</em> Terms in true old <em>Saxon</em>, from
<em>Ælfrick</em>’s Translation of <em>Priscian</em>, to shew the
<em>polite</em> Men of our Age, that the Language of their Forefathers
is neither so barren nor barbarous as they affirm, with equal Ignorance
and Boldness. Since this is such an Instance of its Copiousness, as is
not to be found in any of the polite modern Languages; and the
<em>Latin</em> itself is beholden to the <em>Greek</em>, not only for
the Terms, but even the Names of Arts and Sciences, as is easily
discerned in the Words, <em>Philosophy</em>, <em>Grammar</em>,
<em>Logick</em>, <em>Rhetorick</em>, <em>Geometry</em>,
<em>Arithmetick</em>, &amp;c. These Gentlemens ill Treatment of our
Mother Tongue has led me into a Stile not so agreeable to the Mildness
of our Sex, or the usual manner of my Behaviour, to Persons of your
Character; but the Love and Honour of one’s Countrey, hath in all Ages
been acknowledged such a Virtue, as hath admitted of a Zeal even
somewhat extravagant. <em>Pro Patria mori</em>, used to be one of the
great Boasts of
<span class = "pagenum">iv</span>
Antiquity; and even the so celebrated Magnanimity of <em>Cato</em>, and
such others as have been called Patriots, had wanted their Praise, and
their Admiration, had they wanted this Plea. The Justness and Propriety
of the Language of any Nation, hath been always rightly esteem’d a great
Ornament and Test of the good Sense of such a Nation; and consequently
to arraign the good Sense or Language of any Nation, is to cast upon it
a great Reproach. Even private Men are most jealous, of any Wound, that
can be given them in their intellectual Accomplishments, which they are
less able to endure, than Poverty itself or any other kind of Disgrace.
This hath often occasion’d my Admiration, that those Persons, who talk
so much, of the Honour of our Countrey, <em>of the correcting, improving
and ascertaining</em> of our Language, shou’d dress it up in a Character
so very strange and ridiculous: or to think of improving it to any
degree of Honour and Advantage, by divesting it of the Ornaments of
Antiquity, or separating it from the <em>Saxon</em> Root, whose Branches
were so copious and numerous. But it is very remarkable how Ignorance
will make Men bold, and presume to declare that unnecessary, which they
will not be at the pains to render useful. Such kind of Teachers are no
new thing, the Spirit of Truth itself hath set a mark upon them;
<em>Desiring to be Teachers of the Law, understanding neither what they
say, nor whereof they affirm, 1 <i>Tim.</i> 1. 7.</em> It had been well
if those wise <em>Grammarians</em> had understood this Character, who
have taken upon them to teach our Ladies and young Gentlemen, <em>The
whole System of an English Education</em>; they had not incurr’d those
Self-contradictions of which they are guilty; they had not mention’d
your self, and your incomparable Treasury of <em>Northern
Literature</em> in so cold
<span class = "pagenum">v</span>
and negligent a manner, as betrays too much of an invidious Pedantry:
But in those Terms of Veneration and Applause which are your just
Tribute, not only from the Learned of your own Countrey, but of most of
the other Northern Nations, whether more or less Polite: Who would any
of them have glory’d in having you their Native, who have done so much
Honour to the Original of almost all the Languages in Europe.</p>

<p>But it seems you are not of so much Credit with these
<em>Gentlemen</em>, who question your Authority, and have given a very
visible Proof of their Ingenuity in an Instance which plainly discovers,
that they cannot believe their own Eyes.</p>

<p class = "inset">
“The <em>Saxons</em>, say they, if we may credit Dr. <em>Hickes</em>,
had various Terminations to their Words, at least two in every
Substantive singular: whereas we have no Word now in use, except the
personal Names that has so. Thus Dr. <em>Hickes</em> has made six
several <em>Declensions</em> of the <em>Saxon</em> Names: He gives them
three <em>Numbers</em>; a Singular, Dual, and Plural: We have no Dual
Number, except perhaps in <em>Both</em>: To make this plainer, we shall
transcribe the six Declensions from that Antiquary’s Grammar.”</p>

<p>I would ask these Gentlemen, and why not credit Dr. <em>Hickes</em>?
Is he not as much to be believ’d as those Gentlemen, who have
transcribed so plain an Evidence of the six Declensions to shew the
positive Unreasonableness and unwarrantable Contradiction of their
Disbelief? Did he make those six Declensions? or rather, did he not find
them in the Language, and take so much pains to teach others to
distinguish them, who have Modesty enough to be taught? They are pleased
to say we have no Word now in use that admits of Cases or Terminations.
But let us ask them, what
<span class = "pagenum">vi</span>
they think of these Words, <em>God’s Word</em>, <em>Man’s Wisdom</em>,
the <em>Smith’s Forge</em>, and innumerable Instances more. For in
<em>God’s Word</em>, &amp;c. is not the Termination <em>s</em> a plain
Indication of a Genitive Case, wherein the Saxon <em>e</em> is omitted?
For example,
<span class = "greek" title = "[Saxon] Godes Word">Go?e? ?o??</span>,
<span class = "greek" title = "[Saxon] Mannes Wisdom">Manne?
?i??om</span>,
<span class = "greek" title = "[Saxon] Smiðes Heorð">?miðe?
Heo?ð</span>.
Some will say, that were better supplied by <em>his</em>, or
<em>hers</em>, as Man <em>his</em> Thought, the Smith <em>his</em>
Forge; but this Mistake is justly exploded. Yet if these Gentlemen will
not credit Dr. <em>Hickes</em>, the <em>Saxon</em> Writings might give
them full Satisfaction. The <em>Gospels</em>, the <em>Psalms</em>, and a
great part of the <em>Bible</em> are in <em>Saxon</em>, so are the
<em>Laws</em> and <em>Ecclesiastical Canons</em>, and <em>Charters</em>
of most of our <em>Saxon Kings</em>; these one wou’d think might deserve
their Credit. But they have not had Learning or Industry enough to fit
them for such Acquaintance, and are forc’d therefore to take up their
Refuge with those Triflers, whose only Pretence to Wit, is to despise
their Betters. This Censure will not, I imagine, be thought harsh, by
any candid Reader, since their own Discovery has sufficiently declared
their Ignorance: and their Boldness, to determine things whereof they
are so ignorant, has so justly fix’d upon them the Charge of Impudence.
For otherwise they must needs have been ashamed to proceed in manner
following.</p>

<p class = "inset">
“We might give you various Instances more of the essential difference
between the old <em>Saxon</em> and modern <em>English</em> Tongue, but
these must satisfy any reasonable Man, that it is so great, that the
<em>Saxon</em> can be no Rule to us; and that to understand ours, there
is no need of knowing the <em>Saxon</em>: And tho’ Dr. <em>Hickes</em>
must be allow’d to have been a very curious Enquirer into those obsolete
Tongues, now out of use, and containing nothing valuable, yet it does by
no means follow (as is plain from what has been said)

<p>I would beseech my Readers to observe, the Candour and Ingenuity of
these Gentlemen: They tell us, <em>We might give you various Instances
more of the essential difference between the old <i>Saxon</i> and modern
<i>English</i> Tongue</em>; and yet have plainly made it appear, that
they know little or nothing of the old <em>Saxon</em>. So that it will
be hard to say how they come to know of any such <em>essential
difference, as <i>MUST</i> satisfy any reasonable Man</em>; and much
more that this <em>essential difference</em> is so <em>great, that the
<i>Saxon</i> can be no Rule to us, and that to understand ours, there is
no need of knowing the <i>Saxon</i>.</em> What they say, <em>that it
cannot be a Rule to them</em>, is true; for nothing can be a Rule of
Direction to any Man, the use whereof he does not understand; but if to
understand the Original and Etymology of the Words of any Language, be
needful towards knowing the Propriety of any Language, a thing which I
have never heard hath yet been denied; then do these Gentlemen stand
self-condemned, there being no less than four Words, in the Scheme of
Declensions they have borrowed from Dr. <em>Hickes</em>, now in use,
which are of pure <em>Saxon</em> Original, and consequently
<em>essential to the modern English</em>. I need not tell any English
Reader at this Day the meaning of <em>Smith</em>, <em>Word</em>,
<em>Son</em>, and <em>Good</em>; but if I tell them that these are Saxon
Words, I believe they will hardly deny them to be <em>essential to the
modern English</em>, or that they will conclude that the difference
between the old <em>English</em> and the modern is so great, or the
distance of Relation between them so remote, as that the former deserves
not to be remember’d: except by such Upstarts who having no Title to
<span class = "pagenum">viii</span>
a laudable Pedigree, are backward in all due Respect and Veneration
towards a noble Ancestry.</p>

<p>Their great Condescension to Dr. <em>Hickes</em> in allowing him to
have been a very curious Inquirer into those <em>obsolete Tongues, now
out of use, and containing nothing valuable in them</em>, is a
Compliment for which I believe you, Sir, will give me leave to assure
them, that he is not at all obliged; since if it signifies any thing, it
imports, no less than that he has employ’d a great deal of Time, and a
great deal of Pains, to little purpose. But we must at least borrow so
much Assurance from them, as to tell them, that your Friends, who
consist of the most learned sort of your own Countrey-men, and of
Foreigners, do not think those Tongues so obsolete and out of use, whose
Significancy is so apparent in Etymology; nor do they think those Men
competent Judges to declare, whether there be any thing contained in
them valuable or not, who have made it clear, that they know not what is
<em>contain’d</em> in them. They would rather assure them, that our
greatest <a class = "tag" name = "tagA" id = "tagA" href =
"#noteA">A</a>Divines, and <a class = "tag" name = "tagB" id = "tagB"
href = "#noteB">B</a>Lawyers, and <a class = "tag" name = "tagC" id =
"tagC" href = "#noteC">C</a>Historians are of another Opinion, they
wou’d advise them to consult our Libraries, those of the two
Universities, the <em>Cottonian</em>, and my Lord Treasurers; to study
your whole <em>Thesaurus</em>, particularly your <em>Dissertatio
Epistolaris</em>, to
<span class = "pagenum">ix</span>
<span class = "folionum">C</span>
look into Mr. <em>Wanleys</em> large and accurate Catalogue of
<em>Saxon</em> Manuscripts, and so with Modesty gain a Title to the
Applause of having confest their former Ignorance, and reforming their
Judgment. I believe I may farther take leave to assure them, that the
Doctor is as little concerned for their <em>Inference</em>, which they
think <em>so plain from what has been said, that they are not obliged to
derive the Sense, Construction, or Nature of our present Language from
his Discoveries</em>. He desires them not to <em>derive</em> the
<em>Sense</em> and <em>Construction</em> of which they speak, in any
other manner, than that in which the Nature of the things themselves
makes them appear; and so far as they are his <em>Discoveries</em> only,
intrudes them on no Man. He is very willing they should be let alone by
those, who have not Skill to use them to their own Advantage, and with
Gratitude.</p>

<p>But to leave these Pedagogues to huff and swagger in the heighth of
all their Arrogance. I cannot but think it great Pity, that in our
Considerations, for Refinement of the <em>English</em> Tongue, so little
Regard is had to Antiquity, and the Original of our present Language,
which is the <em>Saxon</em>. This indeed is allow’d by an ingenious
Person, who hath lately made some Proposals for the Refinement of the
<em>English</em> Tongue, <em>That the old <i>Saxon</i>, except in some
few Variations in the Orthography, is the same in most original Words
with our present <i>English</i>, as well as with the <i>German</i> and
other <i>Northern</i> Dialects</em>; which makes it a little surprizing
to me, to find the same Gentleman not long after to say, <em>The other
Languages of <i>Europe</i> I know nothing of, neither is there any
occasion to consider them</em>: because, as I have before observ’d, it
must be very difficult to imagin, how a Man can judge of a thing he
knoweth nothing of, whether there can be
<span class = "pagenum">x</span>
occasion or no to consider it. I must confess I hope when ever such a
Project shall be taken in hand, for <em>correcting</em>,
<em>enlarging</em>, and <em>ascertaining</em> our Language, a competent
Number of such Persons will be advised with, as are knowing, not only in
<em>Saxon</em>, but in the other Languages of <em>Europe</em>, and so be
capable of judging how far those Languages may be useful in such a
Project. The want of understanding this aright, wou’d very much injure
the Success of such an Undertaking, and the bringing of it to
Perfection; in denying that Assistance toward adjusting the Propriety of
Words, which can only be had from the Knowledge of the Original, and
likewise in depriving us of the Benefit of many useful and significant
Words, which might be revived and recalled, to the Increase and Ornament
of our Language, which wou’d be the more beautiful, as being more
genuine and natural, by confessing a <em>Saxon</em> Original for their
native Stock, or an Affinity with those Branches of the other
<em>Northern Tongues</em>, which own the same Original.</p>

<p>The want of knowing the <em>Northern Languages</em>, has occasion’d
an unkind Prejudice towards them: which some have introduced out of
Rashness, others have taken upon Tradition. As if those Languages were
made up of nothing else but Monosyllables, and harsh sounding
Consonants; than which nothing can be a greater Mistake. I can speak for
the <em>Saxon</em>, <em>Gothick</em>, and <em>Francick</em>, or old
<em>Teutonick</em>: which for aptness of compounded, and well sounding
Words, and variety of Numbers, are by those learned Men that understand
them, thought scarce inferior to the <em>Greek</em> itself. I never
cou’d find my self shocked with the Harshness of those Languages, which
grates so much in the Ears of those that never heard them. I never
perceiv’d in the
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<span class = "folionum">C2</span>
Consonants any Hardness, but such as was necessary to afford Strength,
like the Bones in a human Body, which yield it Firmness and Support. So
that the worst that can be said on this occasion of our Forefathers is,
that they spoke at they fought, like Men.</p>

<p>The Author of the <em>Proposal</em>, may think this but an ill
Return, for the soft things he has said of the Ladies, but I think it
Gratitude at least to make the Return, by doing Justice to the
Gentlemen. I will not contradict the Relation of the ingenious
Experiment of his vocal Ladies, tho’ I could give him some Instances to
the contrary, in my Experience of those, whose Writings abound with
Consonants; where Vowels must generally be understood, and appear but
very rarely. Perhaps that Gentleman may be told that I have a
<em>Northern</em> Correspondence, and a <em>Northern</em> Ear, probably
not so fine as he may think his own to be, yet a little musical.</p>

<p>And now for our <em>Monosyllables</em>. In the Controversy concerning
which, it must be examined, first whether the Charge which is exhibited
against the <em>Northern Languages</em> is true, that they consist of
nothing but <em>Monosyllables</em>; and secondly, whether or no the
Copiousness and Variety of <em>Monosyllables</em> may be always justly
reputed a fault, and may not sometimes as justly be thought, to be very
useful and ornamental.</p>

<p>And first I must assert, that the ancient <em>Northern
Languages</em>, do not wholly nor mostly consist of
<em>Monosyllables</em>. I speak chiefly of the <em>Gothick</em>,
<em>Saxon</em>, and <em>Teutonick</em>. It must be confest that in the
<em>Saxon</em>, there are many <em>Primitive</em> Words of one Syllable,
and this to those who know the Esteem that is due to Simplicity and
Plainness, in any Language, will rather be judged a Virtue than a Vice:
That is, that the first Notions of things should be exprest in the
plainest and simplest
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
manner, and in the least compass: and the Qualities and Relations, by
suitable Additions, and Composition of <em>Primitive</em> Words<a class
= "tag" name = "tagD" id = "tagD" href = "#noteD">D</a>; for which the
<em>Saxon</em> Language is very remarkable, as has been before observed,
and of which there are numerous Examples, in the following Treatise of
<em>Saxon Grammar</em>, and infinitely more might have been added.</p>

<p>The second Enquiry is, whether or no the Copiousness and Variety of
<em>Monosyllables</em> may be always justly reputed a fault, and may not
as justly be thought, to be very useful and ornamental? Were this a
fault, it might as justly be charged upon the learned Languages, the
<em>Latin</em> and <em>Greek</em>: For the <em>Latin</em> you have in
<em>Lilly</em>’s Rules concerning Nouns, several Verses, made up for the
most part of <em>Monosyllables</em>, I mention him not as a Classick,
but because the Words are Classical and <em>Monosyllables</em>; and in
the <em>Greek</em> there are several as it were, idle
<em>Monosyllables</em>, that have little Significancy, except to make
the Numbers in Verse compleat, or to give a Fulness to their Periods, as
the Verses of <em>Homer</em> and other <em>Greek Poets</em> plainly
evidence: An Instance or two may suffice;</p>

</div>

<p>Here are seven <em>Monosyllables</em>; yet so far is <em>Virgil</em>
from being angry with his Master <em>Homer</em> on this Account, that he
in a manner transcribes his very Words, imitating him as near as the
<em>Latin</em> wou’d permit;</p>

<p class = "verse">
Quæ sint, quæ fuerint, quæ mox ventura trahantur.</p>

<p>Here is the whole Sense of <em>Homer</em> exprest, and five
<em>Monosyllables</em>. But Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, who has exprest the
Sense of <em>Virgil</em> with no less Accuracy, gives you the whole Line
in <em>Monosyllables</em>;</p>

<p class = "verse">
He sees what is, and was, and is to come.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Pope</em> is equally happy in the Turn he has given to the
Original, who as he is an exact Master of Criticism, so has he all those
Accomplishments of an excellent Poet, that give us just Reason to hope
he will make the Father of the Poets speak to us in our own Language,
with all the Advantages he gave to his Works in that wherein they were
first written, and the modest Opinion he prescribes to his own, and
other Mens Poetical Performances, is no Discouragement to these
Hopes;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "indent">
Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see,</p>
<p>Thinks what ne’er was, nor is, nor e’er shall be.</p>
</div>

<p>And <em>Horace</em>, while he is teaching us the Beauties in the Art
of Poetry, gives no less than nine <em>Monosyllables</em> in the compass
of a Verse and a half;</p>

<div class = "verse ital">
<p><em>Sed nunc non</em> erat <em>his</em> locus: &amp; fortasse
cupressum</p>
<p><em>Scis</em> simulare. <em>Quid hoc si</em>, &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<p>Now if these are Beauties, as I doubt not but the <em>politer
Criticks</em> will allow, I cannot see why our Language may not now and
then be tolerated in using <em>Monosyllables</em>, when it is done
discreetly, and sparingly; and as I do not commend any of our Moderns
who contract Words into <em>Monosyllables</em> to botch up their Verses,
much less such as do it out of Affectation; yet certainly the use of
<em>Monosyllables</em> may be made to produce a charming and harmonious
Effect, where they fall under a Judgment that can rightly dispose and
order them. And indeed, if a Variety and Copiousness of Feet, and a
Latitude of shifting and transposing Words either in Prose or Poetical
Compositions, be of any use, towards the rendering such Compactions
sweet, or nervous, or harmonious, according to the Exigencies of the
several sorts of Stile, one wou’d think <em>Monosyllables</em> to be
best accommodated to all these Purposes, and according to the Skill of
those who know how to manage them, to answer all the Ends, either of
masculine Force, or female Tenderness; for being single you have a
Liberty of placing them where, and as you please; whereas in Words of
many Syllables you are more confined, and must take them as you find
them, or be put upon the cruel necessity of mangling and tearing them
asunder. Mr. <em>Dryden</em>, it is true, wou’d make us believe he had a
great Aversion to <em>Monosyllables</em>. Yet he cannot help making use
of them sometimes in entire Verses, nor conceal his having a sort of
Pride, even where he tells us he was forc’d to do it. For to have done
otherwise would have been a Force on Nature, which would have been
unworthy of so great a Genius, whose Care it was to study Nature, and to
imitate and copy it to the Life; and it is not improbable, that there
might be somewhat of a latent Delicacy and Niceness in this
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
Matter, which he chose rather to dissemble, than to expose, to the
indiscreet Management of meaner Writers. For in the first Line of his
great Work the <em>Æneis</em>, every Word is a <em>Monosyllable</em>;
and tho’ he makes a seeming kind of Apology, yet he cannot forbear
owning a secret Pleasure in what he had done. “My first Line in the
<em>Æneis</em>, says he, is not harsh.</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Arms and the Man I sing, who forc’d by Fate.</p>

<p>“But a much better Instance may be given from the last Line of
<em>Manilius</em>, made <em>English</em> by our learned and judicious
Mr. <em>Creech</em>;</p>

<p class = "verse">
“Nor could the World have born so fierce a Flame.</p>

<p>“Where the many liquid Consonants are placed so artfully, that they
give a pleasing Sound to the Words, tho’ they are all of one
Syllable.”</p>

<p>It is plain from these last Words, that the Subject-matter,
<em>Monosyllables</em>, is not so much to be complain’d of; what is
chiefly to be requir’d, is of the Poet, that he be a good Workman, in
forming them aright, and that he <em>place them artfully</em>: and,
however Mr. <em>Dryden</em> may desire to disguise himself, yet, as he
some where says, Nature will prevail. For see with how much Passion he
has exprest himself towards these two Verses, in which the Poet has not
been sparing of <em>Monosyllables</em>: “I am sure, says he, there are
few who make Verses, have observ’d the Sweetness of these two Lines in
<em>Coopers Hill</em>;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>“Tho deep, yet clear; tho gentle, yet not dull;</p>
<p>“Strong without Rage, without o’erflowing full.</p>
</div>

<span class = "pagenum">xvi</span>
<p>“And there are yet fewer that can find the reason of that Sweetness,
I have given it to some of my Friends in Conversation, and they have
allow’d the Criticism to be just.”</p>

<p>You see, Sir, this great Master had his Reserves, and this was one of
the <em>Arcana</em>, to which every Novice was not admitted to aspire;
this was an Entertainment only for his best Friends, such as he thought
worthy of his Conversation; and I do not wonder at it, for he was
acquainted not only with the <em>Greek</em> and <em>Latin Poets</em>,
but with the best of his own Countrey, as well of ancient as of latter
times, and knew their Beauties and Defects: and tho’ he did not think
himself obliged to be lavish, in dispersing the Fruits of so much Pains
and Labour at random, yet was he not wanting in his Generosity to such
as deserved his Friendship, and in whom he discern’d a Spirit capable of
improving the Hints of so great a Master. To give greater Probability to
what I have said concerning <em>Monosyllables</em>, I will give some
Instances, as well from such Poets as have gone before him, as those
which have succeeded him. It will not be taken amiss by those who value
the Judgment of Sir <em>Philip Sydney</em>, and that of Mr.
<em>Dryden</em>, if I begin with Father <em>Chaucer</em>.</p>

<p>Sir, from these numerous Instances, out of the Writings of our
greatest and noblest Poets, it is apparent, That had the Enmity against
<em>Monosyllables</em>, with which there are some who make so great a
Clamour, been so great in all Times, we must have been deprived of some
of the best Lines, and finest Flowers, that are to be met with in the
beautiful Garden of our <em>English</em> Posie. Perhaps this may put our
Countreymen upon studying with greater Niceness the use of these kind of
Words, as well in the Heroick Compositions, as in the softer and more
gentle Strains. I speak not this, upon Confidence of any Judgment I have
in <em>Poetry</em>, but according to that Skill, which is natural to the
Musick
<span class = "pagenum">xxix</span>
of a <em>Northern Ear</em>, which, if it be deficient, as I shall not be
very obstinate in its Defence, I beg leave it may at least be permitted
the Benefit of Mr. <em>Dryden</em>’s Apology, for the Musick of old
Father <em>Chaucer</em>’s Numbers, “That there is the rude Sweetness of
a <em>Scotch</em> Tune in it, which is natural and pleasing, tho’ not
perfect.”</p>

<p>Sir, I must beg your Pardon for this long Digression, upon a Subject
which many will think does not deserve it: but if I have herein
discover’d some of the greatest Beauties of our <em>English</em> Poets,
it will be more excusable, at least for the respect that is intended to
so noble an Art as theirs. But to suspect the worst, considering that I
am now writing a Preface, I am provided with another Apology from Mr.
<em>Dryden</em>, who cautions his Reader with this Observation, <em>That
the Nature of a Preface is Rambling, never wholly out of the way, nor in
it</em>. Yet I cannot end this Preface, without desiring that such as
shall be employ’d in <em>refining</em> and <em>ascertaining</em> our
<em>English Tongue</em>, may entertain better Thoughts both of the
<em>Saxon Tongue</em>, and of the Study of Antiquities. Methinks it is
very hard, that those who labour and take so much pains to furnish
others with Materials, either for Writing, or for Discourse, who have
not Leisure, or Skill, or Industry enough to serve themselves, shou’d be
allowed no other Instances of Gratitude, than the reproachful Title of
Men of <em>low Genius</em>, of which low Genius’s it may be observed,
that they carry some Ballast, and some valuable Loading in them, which
may be despised, but is seldom to be exceeded in any thing truly
valuable, by light and fluttering Wits. But it is not to be wonder’d,
that Men of Worth are to be trampled upon, for otherwise they might
stand in the way of these Assumers; and indeed were it not for the
Modesty of their Betters,
<span class = "pagenum">xxx</span>
and their own Assurance, they wou’d not only be put out of the way of
those Expectations that they have, but out of all manner of Countenance.
There is a Piece of History that I have met with in the Life of
<em>Archbishop Spotswood</em>, that may not unfitly be remembered on
this Occasion, shewing that studious Men of a private Character are not
always to be reputed Men of <em>low Genius</em>:</p>

<p class = "inset">
“Nor were his Virtues (says the History) buried and confined within the
Boundaries of his Parish, for having formerly had a Relation to the
noble Family of <em>Lenox</em>, he was looked upon as the fittest Person
of his Quality to attend <em>Lodowic</em>, Duke of <em>Lenox</em>, as
his Chaplain in that honourable Embassy to <em>Henry</em> the fourth of
<em>France</em>, for confirming the ancient Amity between both Nations;
wherein he so discreetly carried himself, as added much to his
Reputation, and made it appear that Men bred up in the Shade of Learning
might possibly endure the Sun-shine, and when it came to their turns,
might carry themselves as handsomly abroad, as they (whose Education
being in a more pragmatick way) usually undervalue them.”</p>

<p>But that of <em>low Genius</em> is not the worst Charge which is
brought against the <em>Antiquaries</em>, for they are not allow’d to
have so much as common Sense, or to know how to express their Minds
intelligibly. This I learn from <em>a Dissertation on reading the
Classicks, and forming a just Stile</em>; where it is said, “It must be
a great fault of Judgment if where the Thoughts are proper, the
Expressions are not so too: A&nbsp;Disagreement between these seldom
happens, but among Men of more recondite Studies, and what they call
deep Learning, especially among your <em>Antiquaries</em> and
<em>Schoolmen</em>.” This is a good careless way of talking, it may pass
well enough for the <em>genteel Negligence</em>, in
<span class = "pagenum">xxxi</span>
short, such <em>Nonsense</em>, as <em>Our</em> Antiquaries are seldom
guilty of; for Propriety of Thoughts, without Propriety of Expression is
such a Discovery, as is not easily laid hold of, except by such Hunters
after Spectres and Meteors, as are forced to be content with the Froth
and Scum of Learning, but have indeed nothing to shew of that deep
Learning, which is the effect of recondite Studies. And there was a
Gentleman, no less a Friend to polite Learning, but as good a judge of
it as himself, and who is also a Friend to Antiquities, who was hugely
pleased with the Humour of his saying <em><span class =
"smallcaps">Your</span> Antiquaries</em>, being very ready to disclaim
an Acquaintance with all such Wits, and who told me the Antiquaries,
were the Men in all the World who most contemn’d <em>Your Men of
Sufficiency and Self-conceit</em>. But here his Master <em>Horace</em>
is quite slipt out of his Mind, whose Words are,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Scribendi recte, sapere est &amp; principium &amp; fons.</p>
<p>Rem tibi Socraticæ poterunt ostendere chartæ:</p>
<p>Verbaque provisam rem non invita sequentur.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus translated by my Lord <em>Roscommon</em>,</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>Sound Judgment is the ground of writing well:</p>
<p>And when Philosophy directs your Choice</p>
<p>To proper Subjects rightly understood,</p>
<p>Words from your Pen will naturally flow.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Horace</em>’s <em>Sapere</em>, and my Lord <em>Roscommon</em>’s
<em>Proper Subjects rightly understood</em>, I take to be the same as
<em>Propriety of Thought</em>, and the <em>non invita sequentur,
naturally flowing</em>, I take to import the Fitness and Propriety of
Expression. I also gather from hence, that
<span class = "pagenum">xxxii</span>
there is a very easy and natural Connexion between these two, and these
same Antiquaries of <span class = "gesperrt">OURS</span>, must be either
very dull and stupid Animals, or a strange kind of cross-gran’d and
perverse Fellows, to be always putting a Force upon Nature, and running
out of a plain Road. He must either insinuate that they are indeed such,
or that <em>Horace</em>’s Observation is not just, or that for the Word
<em>invita</em> we ought to have a better reading, for which he will be
forced to consult the <em>Antiquaries</em>. I know not how some of the
great Orators, he has mention’d, will relish his Compliments upon the
Score of Eloquence, when he has said such hard things against
Antiquaries; many of them, and those of chief Note, were his Censure
just and universal, must of necessity be involv’d in it. For example,
the late <em>Bishop</em> of <em>Rochester</em>, of whom, he says, “He
was the correctest Writer of the Age, and comes nearest the great
Originals of <em>Greece</em> and <em>Rome</em>, by a studious Imitation
of the Ancients.” So that, as I take it, he was an Antiquary: If he
excludes <em>English Antiquities</em>, I desire him to remember the
present <em>Bishop</em> of <em>Rochester</em>, of whom he has given this
true Character, “Dr. <em>Atterbury</em> writeth with the fewest Faults,
and greatest Excellencies of any who have studied to mix Art and Nature
in their Compositions, <em>&amp;c</em>.” He hath however thought fit to
adorn the Subject of Antiquities with the Beauties of his Stile, without
any Force upon Nature, or the being obliged to forsake her easy and
unconstrain’d Method of applying proper Expressions to proper Thoughts.
The <em>Bishop</em> of St. <em>Asaph</em> hath shewn his Skill in
Antiquities, by more Instances than one; yet do I not find, that even in
the Opinion of this Gentleman, it hath spoil’d his Stile. I shall add to
these the late and present <em>Bishops</em> of <em>Worcester</em>, the
former,
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiii</span>
<span class = "folionum">F</span>
Dr. <em>Stillingfleet</em>, is allow’d by all to have been one of the
most learned Men and greatest Antiquaries of his Age; and for the
present Bishop, who is also a learned Antiquary, take the Character
which is given of his Skill and Exactness in the <em>English</em> Tongue
from <a class = "tag" name = "tagF" id = "tagF" href =
"#noteF">F</a><em>Bishop Wilkins</em>; “I must acknowledge my self
obliged, saith he, to the continual Assistance I have had from my most
learned and worthy Friend, Dr. <em>William Lloyd</em>, than whom (so far
as I am able to judge) this Nation could not have afforded a fitter
Person, either for that great Industry, or accurate Judgment, both in
<em>Philological</em>, and <em>Philosophical</em> Matters, required to
such a Work. And particularly, I must wholly ascribe to him that tedious
and difficult Task, of suiting the Tables to the <em>Dictionary</em>,
and the drawing up of the <em>Dictionary</em> itself, which, upon trial,
I doubt not, will be found to be the most perfect, that was ever yet
made for the <em>English Tongue</em>.” I will only farther beg leave to
mention, the <em>Bishop</em> of <em>Carlisle</em>, <em>Your Self</em>,
and Dr. <em>Gibson</em>, who for good Spirit, masterly Judgment, and all
the Ornaments of Stile, in the several ways of Writing, may be equalled
with the best and most polite. To conclude, if this Preface is writ in a
Stile, that may be thought somewhat rough and too severe, it is not out
of any natural Inclination to take up a Quarrel, but to do some Justice
to the Study of Antiquities, and even of our own Language itself,
against the severe Censurers of both; whose Behaviour in this
Controversy has been such, as cou’d not have the Treatment it deserved
in a more modest or civil manner. If I am mistaken herein, I beg Pardon:
I might alledge that which perhaps
<span class = "pagenum">xxxiv</span>
might be admitted for an Excuse, but that I will not involve the whole
Sex, by pleading Woman’s Frailty. I confess I thought it would be to
little purpose to write an <em>English Saxon Grammar</em>, if there was
nothing of Worth in that Language to invite any one to the study of it;
so that I have only been upon the Defensive. If any think fit to take up
Arms againsst me, I have great Confidence in the Protection of the
Learned, the Candid, and the Noble; amongst which, from as many as bear
the Ensigns of St. <em>George</em>, I cannot doubt of that help, that
true Chevalrie can afford, to any Damsel in Distress, by cutting off the
Heads of all those Dragons, that dare but to open their Mouths, or begin
to hiss against her. But, Sir, before I conclude, I must do you the
Justice to insert an extract of two Letters from the Right Honourable
<em>D.&nbsp;P.</em> to the Reverend Dr. <em>R.&nbsp;Taylor</em>,
relating to your <em>Thesaurus. Lingg. Vett. Septentrion.</em> which
indeed might more properly have been placed in the eighth Page of this
Preface, had it come sooner to my Hands. It is as follows,</p>

learned Man is one of ten thousand.”</p>

<p>And in another Letter to the abovemention’d Dr. <em>Taylor</em><span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span>. “When <em>Dom.
Mabillon</em> first told me of it, he did not name the Author, so as I
understood who he was, but the Elogium he made of him, was indeed very
great, and I find that the <em>Dean</em> in one Word, has done that
worthy Man Justice.” This high Elogium of your self, and of your great
Work,
<span class = "pagenum">xxxv</span>
from so renowned an Antiquary, as it is a great Defence and Commendation
of the <em>Old Northern Learning</em>, so is it the more remarkable, in
that it was given by one, against whom you had written in the most
tender Point of the Controversy, <em>De Re Diplomatica</em>, as may be
seen in your <em>Lingg. Vett. Septentr. Thesaur. Præfat. General.</em>
p.&nbsp;<em>xxxvi</em>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sir, I once more heartily beg your Pardon for giving you so much
trouble, and beg leave to give you my Thanks for the great Assistance I
have received in the <em>Saxon</em> Studies from your learned Works, and
Conversation; and in particular for your favourable Recommendation of my
Endeavours, in a farther cultivating those Studies, who with sincere
Wishes for your good Health, and all imaginable Respect for a Person of
your Worth and Learning, am,</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
